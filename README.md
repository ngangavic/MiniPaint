Drawing on Canvas Objects

Tutorial link https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-canvas/index.html#0

The types of operations you can perform on a canvas include:

  1. Fill the whole canvas with color.
  2. Draw shapes, such as rectangles, arcs, and paths styled as defined in a Paint object. The Paint object holds the style and color information about how to draw geometries (such as line, rectangle, oval, and paths), or for example, the typeface of text.
  3. Apply transformations, such as translation, scaling, or custom transformations.
  4. Clip, that is, apply a shape or path to the canvas to define its visible portions.
